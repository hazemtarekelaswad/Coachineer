## Daily Calorie Needs *(Harris-Benedict equation)*

### BMR
Calculate your **BMR** using one of the following equations:

- For **men**: 

`BMR = 88.362 + 13.397 * weight(kg) + 4.799 * height(cm) - 5.677 * age(years)`

- For **women**: 

`BMR = 447.593 + 9.247 * weight(kg) + 3.098 * height(cm) - 4.330 * age(years)`

### Activity Level
Determine your **activity level** using the following chart:

*Calories based on BMR and activity level*

- **Sedentary**: little or no exercise, desk job

`Calories = BMR x 1.2`
- **Lightly active**: light exercise or sports 1-3 days a week

`Calories = BMR x 1.375`

- **Moderately active**: moderate exercise or sports 3-5 days a week

`Calories = BMR x 1.55`

- **Very active**: hard exercise or sports 6-7 days a week              

`Calories = BMR x 1.725`

- **Extremely active**: very hard exercise or sports, physical job, training twice a day 

`Calories = BMR x 1.9`

>For example, if you're a 30-year-old woman who weighs 65 kg and is 170 cm tall and moderately active, your daily calorie needs would be:

>BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x 65) + (3.098 x 170) - (4.330 x 30) = 1,442.16 

>Daily calorie needs = 1,442.16 x 1.55 = 2,236.11

If you have a specific goal, such as losing weight or gaining muscle, you'll need to adjust your calorie intake accordingly.

**To lose weight:** daily deficit of 500-1,000 calories.

**To gain muscle**: daily surplus of 250-500 calories.

### BMI
`BMI = weight(kg) / height(m) ^ 2`

---

### Body Fat
Percentage of body fat using **CUN-BAE** method

`CUN−BAE (BF%) = 
    −44.988
    + (0.503 * Age)
    + (10.689 * Sex) 
    + (3.172 * BMI) 
    − (0.026 * BMI^2) 
    + (0.181 * BMI * Sex) 
    − (0.02 * BMI * Age)
    − (0.005 * BMI^2 * Sex)
    + (0.00021 * BMI^2 * Age)`

Sex:
`man = 0`
`woman = 1`

$$ Men=   \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      Normal\ weight & BF \le 20\% \\
      Overweight & 20.1\% \le BF \le 25\% \\
      Obese & BF \gt 25.1\% \\
\end{array} 
\right.  $$

$$ Women=   \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      Normal\ weight & BF \le 30\% \\
      Overweight & 30.1\% \le BF \le 35\% \\
      Obese & BF \gt 35.1\% \\
\end{array} 
\right.  $$
